# üìò Detailed Documentation: Component 5 ‚Äì Multi-Queue Processing System

---

## üìå Overview: What Component 5 Does

The **Multi-Queue Processing System** is designed to intelligently manage inventory allocation requests by:

* Prioritizing requests based on **urgency**, **product type**, and **behavioral signals**.
* Organizing requests into **three distinct processing queues**:

  1. **Emergency Queue** ‚Äì Critical stockouts (highest priority)
  2. **High Priority Queue** ‚Äì Private label products influenced by behavioral intelligence
  3. **Standard Queue** ‚Äì Traditional third-party products
* Ensuring **dynamic processing** that adjusts quantities using behavioral intelligence.
* Providing **auditability** by logging all inventory transactions to the database.

This component ensures **real-time prioritization, traceability, and scalable request management** in the Dynamic Private Label Inventory System.

## üõ†Ô∏è Component Files: Detailed Breakdown

### 1. `/services/multiQueueProcessor.js`

**Purpose: Core queue management and processing service**

#### Key Functions:

* `assignToQueue(allocationRequest)`:
  Determines which queue the request should be added to based on urgency and product type.

* `addToQueue(allocationRequest)`:
  Adds incoming requests to the appropriate queue.

* `processEmergencyQueue()`:
  Processes emergency requests, adds a 20% buffer to the requested quantity, logs the transaction.

* `processHighPriorityQueue()`:
  Processes private label requests with behavioral adjustments and a 50% buffer.

* `processStandardQueue()`:
  Processes third-party requests as-is.

* `processAllQueues()`:
  Runs all three processing functions in order of priority (emergency ‚Üí high priority ‚Üí standard).

* `getQueueStatus()`:
  Returns the number of pending requests in each queue.

---

### 2. `/services/inventoryLogger.js`

**Purpose: Transaction logger for processed allocations**

#### Key Functions:

* `logTransaction({ request_id, store_id, sku, original_quantity, final_quantity, processing_queue })`:
  Logs each allocation into the `inventory_transactions` table using PostgreSQL.

#### Configuration:

* Uses PostgreSQL pool configuration from `/config/db.js`.
* Writes transaction type, quantity change, source, destination, and detailed notes.

---

### 3. `/controllers/queueController.js`

**Purpose: API controller to manage queue requests**

#### Key API Functions:

* `addRequestToQueue(req, res)`:

  * Adds a request to the appropriate queue.

* `processQueues(req, res)`:

  * Triggers processing of all queues and returns processed results.

* `getQueueStatus(req, res)`:

  * Returns the live queue status.

* `loadMockData(req, res)`:

  * Loads predefined mock requests into queues for testing.

* `runDemo(req, res)`:

  * Loads mock requests and immediately processes all queues.

---

### 4. `/routes/queueRoutes.js`

**Purpose: Connects queue controller functions to HTTP routes**

#### API Routes:

* `POST /api/queue/add` ‚Üí Add request to queue.
* `POST /api/queue/process` ‚Üí Process all queues.
* `GET /api/queue/status` ‚Üí Get queue status.
* `POST /api/queue/load-demo` ‚Üí Load mock data into queues.
* `GET /api/queue/demo` ‚Üí Run a complete processing demo.

---

### 5. `/mock/multiQueueMockData.js`

**Purpose: Provides mock data for local and demo testing**

#### Mock Data Includes:

* **Products:**

  * Private label (SKU: `PL-PASTA-001`)
  * Third-party (SKU: `TP-PASTA-001`)

* **Behavioral Signals:**

  * `ST001`: Demand spike expected ‚Üí Multiplier: 1.4
  * `ST002`: Supply disruption expected ‚Üí Multiplier: 1.6

* **Allocation Requests:**

  * Various urgency levels and priority categories.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations Used

### PostgreSQL Connection (`/config/db.js`)

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=inventory_system
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Inventory Transactions Table Structure

| Field                  | Description                                       |

## ‚úÖ How We Tested Component 5

### Testing Setup

* Database: PostgreSQL 17
* Server: Node.js (Express)

### Step 1: Start Server

```bash
node server.js
```

### Step 2: Load Mock Data

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/queue/load-demo
```

‚úÖ Expected: Mock requests loaded into queues.

### Step 3: Check Queue Status

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/queue/status
```

‚úÖ Expected: Response showing queue sizes.

### Step 4: Process Queues

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/queue/process
```

‚úÖ Expected:

* All queues processed.
* Response showing processed items with final quantities.
* Inventory transactions logged in `inventory_transactions` table.

### Step 5: Verify Logs in Database

```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory_transactions;
```

‚úÖ Expected:

* Each processed request should be logged with correct transaction details.

### Step 6: Manual API Testing

Tested via Postman:

* Add custom requests to verify dynamic queue assignment.
* Process queues with varying data sets.
* Confirm queue status updates and transaction logging.

## üîç Notes and Considerations

* **Scalability:** The current design supports batch processing; further optimization may be required for high-volume real-time requests.
* **Cron Jobs:** Can be added to automate periodic queue processing.
* **WebSocket Dashboard:** Deferred for later implementation to provide live queue monitoring.
* **Data Integrity:** Relies on behavioral signals being correctly extracted in earlier components.
